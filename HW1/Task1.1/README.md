Task 1.1

For numbers in the duodecimal numerical system, the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A (ten), and B (eleven) are used. 
When the application starts, it asks the user to input two integers a and b (assume that the user enters integers without errors). 
The application then displays all integers in the range from a (inclusive) to b (inclusive), which in their duodecimal representation 
contain exactly two symbols "A". Develop a console application that implements the specified functionality.

Note 1: To convert a string s to an integer, use the method int.Parse(s).

Note 2: Output the required numbers in the decimal (not duodecimal) numerical system.
