Task 1.3

When starting, the application asks the user for the number of elements in the integer array, 
and then in a loop - the elements themselves (of type int). 
After entering the elements, the application outputs the original array. 
Then create a new array from the original array according to the principle "each value – only once", and output it to the console. 
For example, for the array [1, 1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 6, 7, 1], the array [1, 3, 4, 2, 6, 7] is created. 
Develop a console application that implements the specified functionality.

Note 1: The correctness of the array length may not be controlled.

Note 2: Do not use the standard collections and LINQ!
