Task 3.1.

1. A queue is an abstract data type organized according to the FIFO principle and implements the following operations:

Enqueue(e) � adding an element to the queue.
Dequeue() � removes an element from the queue.
IsEmpty() � checking the queue for emptiness.
To do:

2. Create a universal interface IQueue<T> that describes operations with a queue storing elements of value types.
Create a generic Queue<T> class that implements the IQueue<T> interface. In the Queue<T> class, use one of the queue implementations (to choose from):
- array based
- based on a linked list
- based on two stacks
3. Create a universal extension method Tail<T>() for the IQueue<T> interface. This method returns a new queue consisting of the elements of the original parameter 
- queue minus the first element. For example, for a queue of elements 1, 3, 5, 7, the Tail<T>() extension method will return a queue of elements 3, 5, 7.
4. Test the operation of the created types and methods in a console application.

(*) If you already know something about exceptions and exceptional situations, throw exceptions when an attempt is made to remove an element from an empty queue, 
- or when an element is added when the maximum capacity of the queue has been reached. If you don�t know about exceptions, do nothing when trying to add 
- to a full queue; when trying to extract from an empty queue, return the default(T) value.
